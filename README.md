# Solar-Irradiance-Prediction
This project:
* Using Develop new spectrum and power spectrum analysis algorithms and analyzed predictability of meteorological factors.
* Using improved neural network to predict solar irradiance for photovoltaic power stations
* Improved prediction accuracy by 20.12% compared with existing Neural Network Algorithms


Remarks:
* Codes mainly in Python, but also with c++, r, and some Matlab.
* It contains: prediction trials using NN, improved MLP and LSTM, 4 versions of AFAGPS, new FFT algorithm, preprocess of the data, refining of the data.
* Since develop some new algorithms called AFAGPS from scratch, the coder tried multiple language and ways to finish it.
* The functions inside <b>AFAGPS-v4.ipynb</b> are the final version.
